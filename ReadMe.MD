This is a new Archery Module for the Minigames plugin.

It adds targets of both Entities and Blocks

## Known Issues ##
* The AddAction menu will not updat the GUI - the action is added and requires the menu to be refreshed to see it.
* Entities must be flagged as persistent - for this module to really work. (Just the ones that are targets) You should use another plugin to do this.
